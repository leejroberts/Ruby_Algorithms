to make a binary search tree

the tree will not work optimally if the values are not shuffled before insertion

duplicate values are not added

added values are inserted in the following manner
  starting with the current node == the root node
  1. if the value is smaller than the current node, and the left branch is not taken
    value is inserted into a node at the current node's left_branch
  1. if the value is larger than the current node, and the left branch is not taken
    value is inserted into a node at the current node's left_branch
  1. in the left or right branch node of the current node, if the position is not taken

  in a left branch if the current node's value is smaller
  in a right branch if the current node's value is larger
